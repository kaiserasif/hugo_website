### About Me

I have completed my PhD in Machine Learning from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uic.edu/) at University of Illinois at Chicago [(UIC)](https://www.uic.edu/). I worked with [Prof. Brian Ziebart](https://www.cs.uic.edu/Ziebart) in Adversarial Framework for Cost-sensitive Classification and Sequence Tagging. I completed my BS in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology [(BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).
